# Blockchain-Based Personal AI Assistant

## Overview

This project implements a decentralized AI assistant that interacts with users on-chain, answering questions and learning from community-provided data. The assistant stores learned data as NFTs, allowing users to own the AI's knowledge about specific topics.

## Features

- Community-governed AI data updates
- AI-generated answers tied to NFTs (users can "own" certain knowledge)
- Privacy-focused, as user interactions and responses are logged on-chain but controlled by private keys

## Technology Stack

- Smart Contract: Clarity (for Stacks blockchain)
- Testing: Vitest
- Development Environment: Clarinet

## Getting Started

1. Install Clarinet: Follow the instructions at https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet

2. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-ai-assistant.git

   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```
   clarinet test
   ```

## Smart Contract: ai-assistant.clar

The main smart contract implements the following functionality:

- Minting new knowledge NFTs
- Updating knowledge data (only by token owners)
- Querying knowledge data
- Implementing the SIP009 NFT standard

## Testing

The `ai-assistant.test.ts` file contains Vitest tests covering the main functionality of the smart contract. To run the tests, use the `clarinet test` command.
